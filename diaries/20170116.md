ZEIT ONLINE: So how can we extend that notion of "we"?

Butler: I think it is the question of how you live with people, a question of cohabitation. Do you also seek to learn their lives, to learn their languages? Do you always treat them as a recipient of your generosity, or do you come to regard them as your equal? Do you accept that German is not the only language that is spoken in Germany? Do you accept that assistance and support needs to be given to various religious communities and that they should not just feel welcome, but also part of what Germany is and is becoming? I think that too often there has been this effort to adapt the migrant to German culture as it is.

ZEIT ONLINE: You can see it in the Trump rhetoric, you can see it in Brexit, you can see it in right-wing populist language, there is a move back to an ethnic understanding of nationality. Why?

Butler: Hannah Arendt should be our guide here: As long as one functions within the notion of the nation-state, one is basically asking for a specific nationality to represent the state and for the state to represent that nationality. That means that there will always be the minorities and those excluded, those who do not conform to the dominant idea of the nation: they will be ineligible for full rights, or stripped of rights, or even expelled. That is why for her plurality is so important. And I guess I could translate plurality into racial and ethnic heterogeneity. But heterogeneity is where Europe is right now. It's the new Europe.

*Writers and the community as a whole were gladdened by a visit recently of Anais Nin, who spoke about new techniques and structures and the use of the unconscious in writing, and the responsibility of a writer. She conferred generously with individuals and carried away with her a couple of manuscripts. She was particularly interested in the print shop, since she and her husband hand-set all of her works for years before they were sought by a commercial publisher. She believes that the influence upon writing would be for the best if every writer had to print some of his own works*
